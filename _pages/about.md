I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Oberlin College. At the University of Maryland, I was advised by [Michelle Mazurek](https://mmazurek.umiacs.io/). My research interests focus on the intersection of computer security and at-risk users - people who, due to context or circumstance, experience elevated digital-safety risks and harms.
