This course is an introduction to the field of human-centered security to upper-level CS majors, focusing on basic empirical methods in computer science, fundamental security and privacy concepts, and reading a wide variety of relevant papers.

This particular semester, I switched to a **collaborative grading** model, where instead of giving numerical grades, I exclusively gave qualitative feedback. Students decided their grade with my help at the end of the semester after reviewing a portfolio of their work. I was surprised to see students were actually *more* engaged and did *more* work than the previous semester, not less!
