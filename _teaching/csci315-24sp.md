This course is an introduction to the field of human-centered security to upper-level CS majors, focusing on basic empirical methods in computer science, fundamental security and privacy concepts, and reading a wide variety of relevant papers.

This was my first course that I developed on my own, with significant inspiration from Michelle Mazurek's version of this course at the graduate level. It went through a lot of iteration when I taught it again the following fall!
